This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C programming when accessing array elements. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides the corrected version.  The error involves accessing an array element beyond its valid index range, leading to undefined behavior. This example highlights the importance of careful loop condition checks in C to prevent such errors and ensure memory safety.
